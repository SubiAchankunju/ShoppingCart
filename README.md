# Shopping Cart
This app is a shopping cart shell for a hypothetical e-commerce platform named `Small Basket`  
It is developed using custom built data structures (https://github.com/amoldhamale1105/CustomDataStructures) and event loop (https://github.com/amoldhamale1105/EventLoop)     
The shopping cart shell can accepts commands for various functions of the cart  

## Build instructions
The app can be built using the `build.sh` script in the project source tree. It can be run without any options for default build configuration. Defaults for each option will appear in `{}` in the usage instruction. Learn about script usage with the following command
```
./build.sh -h
```
Build artifacts will be generated in the `build` directory  
Output artifact will be present in the `bin` directory as `ShoppingCart` binary

## How it works
TBD
